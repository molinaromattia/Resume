    * Focus on computational mathematics and quantitative techniques (Monte Carlo methods, time series, GLMs, models for longitudinal and cross-sectional data, etc.)
    * Master thesis: “Statistical models for sectional and panel data”. I thoroughly explored numerous types of linear models and compared them empirically through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on their assumptions and limitations

    In collaboration with the spin-off Isomorph, in my bachelor’s thesis I took ownership of the implementation of an advanced algorithm in Matlab whose goal is to measure lengths of objects based on two photographs. I used Matlab, the specialized real-time computer-vision library OpenCV and techniques coming from computational geometry
