  Hello and welcome to my online resume! I am Mattia, a data analytics expert with extensive practical industrial experience, ranging from a healthcare start-up to major investment banks. As a trained mathematician, I believe that to succeed in this domain one needs to have sound theoretical and practical knowledge of statistics and machine learning for big data and “small data”.

  I am a fast thinker, quick learner and committed team player. I presented my results in front of highly technical audiences as well as in front of senior management. I am a native Italian speaker and fluent in English and German. Currently I am trying to broaden my linguistical horizons by learning Mandarin :) 

  My specialties are: <mark>statistics</mark>, <mark>machine learning</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark> and <mark>Spark</mark>
